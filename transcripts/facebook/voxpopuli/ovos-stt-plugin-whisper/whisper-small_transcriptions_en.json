So some say it's not our business, let them dismantle democracy in Hungary if that's what they want to do. Well, no, because we stand in solidarity, as was said here before, with all those Hungarians that fight for democracy, for rights every day, they are not alone. And secondly, we make laws together, we make laws together here. And the authoritarian regime in Hungary will make laws that all of us will have to respect. And that's not acceptable. So standing up for law and democracy and fundamental rights in Hungary is standing up for rule and democracy, rule of law and democracy for all of us. Luckily in this house, there are many of us that will not let Hungary dismantle democracy. And it's all about our business. So the question is then, what is the commission doing? What is the council doing? When will the EPP expel and actually break up with Fidesz? It's a shame on you to have them there. The commission, the infringement procedures, we are waiting for them. And the council, you are so weak in your statement. It is not enough. We need you to come up with a conditionality clause in the new MFF. You have to be extremely strict on that and no recovery funds, no recovery funds to member states that don't to member states that don't respect rule of law and democracy. It is time for the Commission and the Council to get into the game. This House will stand up for democracy and human rights."
