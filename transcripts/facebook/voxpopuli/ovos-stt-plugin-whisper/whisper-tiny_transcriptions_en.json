        "transcript": " government to follow suit. And that's why we have to react in this house. And we have this time using the COVID crisis as an excuse, ruling by the degree without the degree without the sunset close, threatening journalists and whistleblowers, passing laws and policies that has nothing to do with the public health crisis such as rejecting the Istanbul Convention or attacking trans people's rights. So, some say it's not our business, let them dismantle democracy in Hungary if that's what they want to do. Well, no, because we stand in solidarity, as was said here before, with all those hangarists that fight for democracy for rights every day, they are not alone. And secondly, we make laws together, we make laws together here. And the authoritarian regime in Hungary will make laws that all of us will have to respect. And that's not acceptable. So standing up for law and democracy in Hungary is standing up for rule and democracy. Rule of law and democracy for all. Rule of law and democracy for all of us. Luckily in this house, there are many of us that will not let Hungary dismantle democracy. And it's all about our business. So the question is then, what is the commission doing, what is the council doing, when with the EPP, expel and actually break up with Fedes, it's a shame on you to have them there. The commission, the infringements procedures, we are waiting for them. And the council, you are so weak in your statement, it is not enough. We need you to come up with a conditionality close in the new MFF. You have to be extremely strict on that and no recovery funds, no recovery funds to member states that don't respect rule of law and democracy. It is time for the commission and the council to get into the game. This house will stand up for democracy and human rights."
